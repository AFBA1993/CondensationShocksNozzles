# CondensationShocksNozzles
This repository contains the implemented python code for characterizing condensation in nozzle flows related to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121212.

For a deeper understanding of the implemented algorithms, please read the published paper as well as the Masters' Thesis entitled "Two approximations for solving non-equilibribum condensation shocks in nozzle flows" which will be availiable in Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo's repositories.
